# Algorithms - Part 1
I'm using this repository to take notes as I work through the lecture slides of the course *Algorithms - Part 1*, taught by Robert Sedgewick at Princeton via Coursera. You can take the course for free here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/

As I work through the lecture slides, I'm re-creating many of the algorithms I encounter and writing unit tests for each one as a way to help me understand the code. Please note that much of this code is hand-copied from similar algorithms on the course site. 

When I started this course (Dec. 2016) this was my very first exposure to the Java language, so you may encounter some quite un-idomatic Java code in this repo - you have been warned! I hope that by the time I complete this course my language skills have improved substantially.

I'm also posting unit-tests for my solutions to the weekly assignments, but I am **not** posting the solutions to the assignments themselves. If you are currently taking the course and need help with the assignments I strongly urge you to check out the discussion forums on Coursera. 

For those of you taking this course, I highly recommend purchasing the companion textbook: https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1494416946&sr=8-2&keywords=algorithms which should be used as a reference guide (the pictures/visualizations of the algorithms are quite good).
